# Django Calculator

The repository contains a simple calculator application based on the Django framework. The project aims to demonstrate basic skills in using Django and JavaScript in the context of building interactive web applications.

The application allows for basic mathematical operations to be performed through a button-based user interface. Calculation results are automatically saved to a database, allowing users to store their calculation history.

The repository includes the full source code of the project, along with relevant configuration files and HTML templates. Additionally, JavaScript scripts handling user interactions and data validation functions are also available.
